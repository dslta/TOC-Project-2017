Despite practical challenges, we are hopeful that
informed discussions among policy-makers and the
public about data and the capabilities of machine
learning, will lead to insightful designs of programs
and policies that can balance the goals of protecting
privacy and ensuring fairness with those of reaping
the benefits to scientific research and to individual
and public health. Our commitments to privacy and
fairness are evergreen, but our policy choices must
adapt to advance them, and support new tech-
niques for deepening our knowledge.

M achine learning is a discipline focused

on two interrelated questions: How can
one construct computer systems that auto-
matically improve through experience?
and What are the fundamental statistical-
computational-information-theoretic laws that
govern all learning systems, including computers,
humans, and organizations? The study of machine
learning is important both for addressing these
fundamental scientific and engineering ques-
tions and for the highly practical computer soft-
ware it has produced and fielded across many
applications.

Machine learning has progressed dramati-
cally over the past two decades, from laboratory
curiosity to a practical technology in widespread
commercial use. Within artificial intelligence (AI),
machine learning has emerged as the method
of choice for developing practical software for
computer vision, speech recognition, natural lan-
guage processing, robot control, and other ap-
plications. Many developers of AI systems now
recognize that, for many applications, it can be
far easier to train a system by showing it exam-
ples of desired input-output behavior than to
program it manually by anticipating the desired
response for all possible inputs. The effect of ma-
chine learning has also been felt broadly across
computer science and across a range of indus-
tries concerned with data-intensive issues, such
as consumer services, the diagnosis of faults in
complex systems, and the control of logistics
chains. There has been a similarly broad range of
effects across empirical sciences, from biology to
cosmology to social science, as machine-learning
methods have been developed to analyze high-
throughput experimental data in novel ways. See
Fig. 1 for a depiction of some recent areas of ap-
plication of machine learning.

A learning problem can be defined as the
problem of improving some measure of perform-

REVIEW

Machine learning: Trends,
perspectives, and prospects

M. I. Jordan1* and T. M. Mitchell2*

Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that improve
automatically through experience. It is one of today’s most rapidly growing technical fields,
lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial
intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by
the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the
availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive
machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce,
leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including
health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.

ance when executing some task, through some
type of training experience. For example, in learn-
ing to detect credit-card fraud, the task is to as-
sign a label of “fraud” or “not fraud” to any given
credit-card transaction. The performance metric
to be improved might be the accuracy of this
fraud classifier, and the training experience might
consist of a collection of historical credit-card
transactions, each labeled in retrospect as fraud-
ulent or not. Alternatively, one might define a
different performance metric that assigns a higher
penalty when “fraud” is labeled “not fraud” than
when “not fraud” is incorrectly labeled “fraud.”
One might also define a different type of training
experience—for example, by including unlab-
eled credit-card transactions along with labeled
examples.

A diverse array of machine-learning algorithms
has been developed to cover the wide variety of
data and problem types exhibited across differ-
ent machine-learning problems (1, 2). Conceptual-
ly, machine-learning algorithms can be viewed as
searching through a large space of candidate
programs, guided by training experience, to find
a program that optimizes the performance metric.
Machine-learning algorithms vary greatly, in part
by the way in which they represent candidate
programs (e.g., decision trees, mathematical func-
tions, and general programming languages) and in
part by the way in which they search through this
space of programs (e.g., optimization algorithms
with well-understood convergence guarantees
and evolutionary search methods that evaluate
successive generations of randomly mutated pro-
grams). Here, we focus on approaches that have
been particularly successful to date.

Many algorithms focus on function approxi-
mation problems, where the task is embodied
in a function (e.g., given an input transaction, out-
put a “fraud” or “not fraud” label), and the learn-
ing problem is to improve the accuracy of that
function, with experience consisting of a sample
of known input-output pairs of the function. In
some cases, the function is represented explicit-
ly as a parameterized functional form; in other
cases, the function is implicit and obtained via a
search process, a factorization, an optimization

areas of technology and science; examples of recent applied success stories include robotics and

procedure, or a simulation-based procedure. Even
when implicit, the function generally depends
on parameters or other tunable degrees of free-
dom, and training corresponds to finding values
for these parameters that optimize the perform-
ance metric.

Whatever the learning algorithm, a key scien-
tific and practical goal is to theoretically character-
ize the capabilities of specific learning algorithms
and the inherent difficulty of any given learning
problem: How accurately can the algorithm learn
from a particular type and volume of training
data? How robust is the algorithm to errors in its
modeling assumptions or to errors in the train-
ing data? Given a learning problem with a given
volume of training data, is it possible to design a
successful algorithm or is this learning problem
fundamentally intractable? Such theoretical char-
acterizations of machine-learning algorithms and
problems typically make use of the familiar frame-
works of statistical decision theory and compu-
tational complexity theory. In fact, attempts to
characterize machine-learning algorithms the-
oretically have led to blends of statistical and
computational theory in which the goal is to simul-
taneously characterize the sample complexity
(how much data are required to learn accurately)
and the computational complexity (how much
computation is required) and to specify how these
depend on features of the learning algorithm such
as the representation it uses for what it learns
(3–6). A specific form of computational analysis
that has proved particularly useful in recent
years has been that of optimization theory,
with upper and lower bounds on rates of con-
vergence of optimization procedures merging
well with the formulation of machine-learning
problems as the optimization of a performance
metric (7, 8).

As a field of study, machine learning sits at the
crossroads of computer science, statistics and a
variety of other disciplines concerned with auto-
matic improvement over time, and inference and
decision-making under uncertainty. Related dis-
ciplines include the psychological study of human
learning, the study of evolution, adaptive control
theory, the study of educational practices, neuro-
science, organizational behavior, and economics.
Although the past decade has seen increased cross-
talk with these other fields, we are just beginning
to tap the potential synergies and the diversity
of formalisms and experimental methods used
across these multiple fields for studying systems
that improve with experience.

Drivers of machine-learning progress
The past decade has seen rapid growth in the
ability of networked and mobile computing sys-
tems to gather and transport vast amounts of
data, a phenomenon often referred to as “Big
Data.” The scientists and engineers who collect
such data have often turned to machine learn-
ing for solutions to the problem of obtaining
useful insights, predictions, and decisions from
such data sets. Indeed, the sheer size of the data
makes it essential to develop scalable proce-
dures that blend computational and statistical

considerations, but the issue is more than the
mere size of modern data sets; it is the granular,
personalized nature of much of these data. Mo-
bile devices and embedded computing permit
large amounts of data to be gathered about in-
dividual humans, and machine-learning algo-
rithms can learn from these data to customize
their services to the needs and circumstances
of each individual. Moreover, these personalized
services can be connected, so that an overall ser-
vice emerges that takes advantage of the wealth
and diversity of data from many individuals
while still customizing to the needs and circum-
stances of each. Instances of this trend toward
capturing and mining large quantities of data to
improve services and productivity can be found
across many fields of commerce, science, and
government. Historical medical records are used
to discover which patients will respond best
to which treatments; historical traffic data are
used to improve traffic control and reduce con-
gestion; historical crime data are used to help
allocate local police to specific locations at spe-
cific times; and large experimental data sets are
captured and curated to accelerate progress in
biology, astronomy, neuroscience, and other data-
intensive empirical sciences. We appear to be at
the beginning of a decades-long trend toward in-
creasingly data-intensive, evidence-based decision-
making across many aspects of science, commerce,
and government.

With the increasing prominence of large-scale
data in all areas of human endeavor has come a
wave of new demands on the underlying machine-
learning algorithms. For example, huge data sets
require computationally tractable algorithms, high-
ly personal data raise the need for algorithms
that minimize privacy effects, and the availabil-
ity of huge quantities of unlabeled data raises
the challenge of designing learning algorithms
to take advantage of it. The next sections survey
some of the effects of these demands on recent

work in machine-learning algorithms, theory, and
practice.

Core methods and recent progress
The most widely used machine-learning methods
are supervised learning methods (1). Supervised
learning systems, including spam classifiers of
e-mail, face recognizers over images, and med-
ical diagnosis systems for patients, all exemplify
the function approximation problem discussed
earlier, where the training data take the form of
a collection of (x, y) pairs and the goal is to
produce a prediction y* in response to a query
x*. The inputs x may be classical vectors or they
may be more complex objects such as documents,
images, DNA sequences, or graphs. Similarly,
many different kinds of output y have been studied.
Much progress has been made by focusing on
the simple binary classification problem in which
y takes on one of two values (for example, “spam”
or “not spam”), but there has also been abun-
dant research on problems such as multiclass
classification (where y takes on one of K labels),
multilabel classification (where y is labeled simul-
taneously by several of the K labels), ranking
problems (where y provides a partial order on
some set), and general structured prediction
problems (where y is a combinatorial object such
as a graph, whose components may be required
to satisfy some set of constraints). An example
of the latter problem is part-of-speech tagging,
where the goal is to simultaneously label every
word in an input sentence x as being a noun,
verb, or some other part of speech. Supervised
learning also includes cases in which y has real-
valued components or a mixture of discrete and
real-valued components.

Supervised learning systems generally form
their predictions via a learned mapping f(x),
which produces an output y for each input x (or
a probability distribution over y given x). Many
different forms of mapping f exist, including

decision trees, decision forests, logistic regres-
sion, support vector machines, neural networks,
kernel machines, and Bayesian classifiers (1). A
variety of learning algorithms has been proposed
to estimate these different types of mappings, and
there are also generic procedures such as boost-
ing and multiple kernel learning that combine
the outputs of multiple learning algorithms.
Procedures for learning f from data often make
use of ideas from optimization theory or numer-
ical analysis, with the specific form of machine-
learning problems (e.g., that the objective function
or function to be integrated is often the sum over
a large number of terms) driving innovations. This
diversity of learning architectures and algorithms
reflects the diverse needs of applications, with
different architectures capturing different kinds
of mathematical structures, offering different lev-
els of amenability to post-hoc visualization and
explanation, and providing varying trade-offs
between computational complexity, the amount
of data, and performance.

One high-impact area of progress in supervised
learning in recent years involves deep networks,
which are multilayer networks of threshold units,
each of which computes some simple param-
eterized function of its inputs (9, 10). Deep learning
systems make use of gradient-based optimiza-
tion algorithms to adjust parameters throughout
such a multilayered network based on errors at
its output. Exploiting modern parallel comput-
ing architectures, such as graphics processing
units originally developed for video gaming, it
has been possible to build deep learning sys-
tems that contain billions of parameters and
that can be trained on the very large collections
of images, videos, and speech samples available
on the Internet. Such large-scale deep learning
systems have had a major effect in recent years
in computer vision (11) and speech recognition
(12), where they have yielded major improve-
ments in performance over previous approaches

Fig. 3. Topic models. Topic modeling is a methodology for analyzing documents, where a document is viewed as a collection of words, and the words in
the document are viewed as being generated by an underlying set of topics (denoted by the colors in the figure). Topics are probability distributions
across words (leftmost column), and each document is characterized by a probability distribution across topics (histogram). These distributions are
inferred based on the analysis of a collection of documents and can be viewed to classify, index, and summarize the content of documents. [From (31).

(see Fig. 2). Deep network methods are being
actively pursued in a variety of additional appli-
cations from natural
language translation to
collaborative filtering.

The internal layers of deep networks can be
viewed as providing learned representations of
the input data. While much of the practical suc-
cess in deep learning has come from supervised
learning methods for discovering such repre-
sentations, efforts have also been made to devel-
op deep learning algorithms that discover useful
representations of the input without the need for
labeled training data (13). The general problem is
referred to as unsupervised learning, a second
paradigm in machine-learning research (2).

Broadly, unsupervised learning generally in-
volves the analysis of unlabeled data under as-
sumptions about structural properties of the
data (e.g., algebraic, combinatorial, or probabi-
listic). For example, one can assume that data
lie on a low-dimensional manifold and aim to
identify that manifold explicitly from data. Di-
mension reduction methods—including prin-
cipal components analysis, manifold learning,
factor analysis, random projections, and autoen-
coders (1, 2)—make different specific assump-
tions regarding the underlying manifold (e.g.,
that it is a linear subspace, a smooth nonlinear
manifold, or a collection of submanifolds). An-
other example of dimension reduction is the
topic modeling framework depicted in Fig. 3.
A criterion function is defined that embodies
these assumptions—often making use of general
statistical principles such as maximum like-
lihood, the method of moments, or Bayesian
integration—and optimization or sampling algo-

258

rithms are developed to optimize the criterion.
As another example, clustering is the problem
of finding a partition of the observed data (and
a rule for predicting future data) in the absence
of explicit labels indicating a desired partition.
A wide range of clustering procedures has been
developed, all based on specific assumptions
regarding the nature of a “cluster.” In both clus-
tering and dimension reduction, the concern
with computational complexity is paramount,
given that the goal is to exploit the particularly
large data sets that are available if one dis-
penses with supervised labels.

A third major machine-learning paradigm is
reinforcement learning (14, 15). Here, the infor-
mation available in the training data is inter-
mediate between supervised and unsupervised
learning. Instead of training examples that in-
dicate the correct output for a given input, the
training data in reinforcement learning are as-
sumed to provide only an indication as to whether
an action is correct or not; if an action is incor-
rect, there remains the problem of finding the
correct action. More generally, in the setting of
sequences of inputs, it is assumed that reward
signals refer to the entire sequence; the assign-
ment of credit or blame to individual actions in the
sequence is not directly provided. Indeed, although
simplified versions of reinforcement learning
known as bandit problems are studied, where it
is assumed that rewards are provided after each
action, reinforcement learning problems typically
involve a general control-theoretic setting in
which the learning task is to learn a control strat-
egy (a “policy”) for an agent acting in an unknown
dynamical environment, where that learned strat-

egy is trained to chose actions for any given state,
with the objective of maximizing its expected re-
ward over time. The ties to research in control
theory and operations research have increased
over the years, with formulations such as Markov
decision processes and partially observed Mar-
kov decision processes providing points of con-
tact (15, 16). Reinforcement-learning algorithms
generally make use of ideas that are familiar
from the control-theory literature, such as policy
iteration, value iteration, rollouts, and variance
reduction, with innovations arising to address
the specific needs of machine learning (e.g., large-
scale problems, few assumptions about the un-
known dynamical environment, and the use of
supervised learning architectures to represent
policies). It is also worth noting the strong ties
between reinforcement learning and many dec-
ades of work on learning in psychology and
neuroscience, one notable example being the
use of reinforcement learning algorithms to pre-
dict the response of dopaminergic neurons in
monkeys learning to associate a stimulus light
with subsequent sugar reward (17).

Although these three learning paradigms help
to organize ideas, much current research involves
blends across these categories. For example, semi-
supervised learning makes use of unlabeled data
to augment labeled data in a supervised learning
context, and discriminative training blends ar-
chitectures developed for unsupervised learning
with optimization formulations that make use
of labels. Model selection is the broad activity of
using training data not only to fit a model but
also to select from a family of models, and the
fact that training data do not directly indicate

which model to use leads to the use of algo-
rithms developed for bandit problems and to
Bayesian optimization procedures. Active learn-
ing arises when the learner is allowed to choose
data points and query the trainer to request tar-
geted information, such as the label of an other-
wise unlabeled example. Causal modeling is the
effort to go beyond simply discovering predictive
relations among variables, to distinguish which
variables causally influence others (e.g., a high
white-blood-cell count can predict the existence
of an infection, but it is the infection that causes
the high white-cell count). Many issues influence
the design of learning algorithms across all of
these paradigms, including whether data are
available in batches or arrive sequentially over
time, how data have been sampled, require-
ments that learned models be interpretable by
users, and robustness issues that arise when
data do not fit prior modeling assumptions.

Emerging trends
The field of machine learning is sufficiently young
that it is still rapidly expanding, often by invent-
ing new formalizations of machine-learning
problems driven by practical applications. (An
example is the development of recommendation
systems, as described in Fig. 4.) One major trend
driving this expansion is a growing concern with
the environment in which a machine-learning
algorithm operates. The word “environment”
here refers in part to the computing architecture;
whereas a classical machine-learning system in-
volved a single program running on a single ma-
chine, it is now common for machine-learning
systems to be deployed in architectures that in-
clude many thousands or ten of thousands of
processors, such that communication constraints
and issues of parallelism and distributed pro-
cessing take center stage. Indeed, as depicted
in Fig. 5, machine-learning systems are increas-
ingly taking the form of complex collections of
software that run on large-scale parallel and dis-
tributed computing platforms and provide a range
of algorithms and services to data analysts.

The word “environment” also refers to the
source of the data, which ranges from a set of
people who may have privacy or ownership con-
cerns, to the analyst or decision-maker who may
have certain requirements on a machine-learning
system (for example, that its output be visual-
izable), and to the social, legal, or political frame-
work surrounding the deployment of a system.
The environment also may include other machine-
learning systems or other agents, and the overall
collection of systems may be cooperative or ad-
versarial. Broadly speaking, environments pro-
vide various resources to a learning algorithm
and place constraints on those resources. Increas-
ingly, machine-learning researchers are formalizing
these relationships, aiming to design algorithms
that are provably effective in various environ-
ments and explicitly allow users to express and
control trade-offs among resources.

As an example of resource constraints, let us
suppose that the data are provided by a set of
individuals who wish to retain a degree of pri-

vacy. Privacy can be formalized via the notion of
“differential privacy,” which defines a probabi-
listic channel between the data and the outside
world such that an observer of the output of the
channel cannot infer reliably whether particular
individuals have supplied data or not (18). Clas-
sical applications of differential privacy have
involved insuring that queries (e.g., “what is the
maximum balance across a set of accounts?”) to
a privatized database return an answer that is
close to that returned on the nonprivate data.
Recent research has brought differential privacy
into contact with machine learning, where que-
ries involve predictions or other inferential asser-
tions (e.g., “given the data I've seen so far, what is
the probability that a new transaction is fraud-
ulent?”) (19, 20). Placing the overall design of a
privacy-enhancing machine-learning system
within a decision-theoretic framework provides
users with a tuning knob whereby they can choose
a desired level of privacy that takes into account
the kinds of questions that will be asked of the
data and their own personal utility for the an-
swers. For example, a person may be willing to

Fig. 4. Recommendation systems. A recommen-
dation system is a machine-learning system that is
based on data that indicate links between a set
of a users (e.g., people) and a set of items (e.g.,
products). A link between a user and a product
means that the user has indicated an interest in
the product in some fashion (perhaps by purchas-
ing that item in the past).The machine-learning prob-
lem is to suggest other items to a given user that he
or she may also be interested in, based on the data
across all users.

reveal most of their genome in the context of
research on a disease that runs in their family
but may ask for more stringent protection if in-
formation about their genome is being used to
set insurance rates.

Communication is another resource that needs
to be managed within the overall context of a
distributed learning system. For example, data
may be distributed across distinct physical loca-
tions because their size does not allow them to
be aggregated at a single site or because of ad-
ministrative boundaries. In such a setting, we may
wish to impose a bit-rate communication con-
straint on the machine-learning algorithm. Solving
the design problem under such a constraint will
generally show how the performance of the learn-
ing system degrades under decrease in commu-
nication bandwidth, but it can also reveal how
the performance improves as the number of dis-
tributed sites (e.g., machines or processors) in-
creases, trading off these quantities against the
amount of data (21, 22). Much as in classical in-
formation theory, this line of research aims at
fundamental lower bounds on achievable per-
formance and specific algorithms that achieve
those lower bounds.

A major goal of this general line of research is
to bring the kinds of statistical resources studied
in machine learning (e.g., number of data points,
dimension of a parameter, and complexity of a
hypothesis class) into contact with the classical
computational resources of time and space. Such
a bridge is present in the “probably approximately
correct” (PAC) learning framework, which studies
the effect of adding a polynomial-time compu-
tation constraint on this relationship among error
rates, training data size, and other parameters of
the learning algorithm (3). Recent advances in
this line of research include various lower bounds
that establish fundamental gaps in performance
achievable in certain machine-learning prob-
lems (e.g., sparse regression and sparse princi-
pal components analysis) via polynomial-time
and exponential-time algorithms (23). The core
of the problem, however, involves time-data trade-
offs that are far from the polynomial/exponential
boundary. The large data sets that are increas-
ingly the norm require algorithms whose time
and space requirements are linear or sublinear in
the problem size (number of data points or num-
ber of dimensions). Recent research focuses on
methods such as subsampling, random projec-
tions, and algorithm weakening to achieve scal-
ability while retaining statistical control (24, 25).
The ultimate goal is to be able to supply time
and space budgets to machine-learning systems
in addition to accuracy requirements, with the
system finding an operating point that allows
such requirements to be realized.

Opportunities and challenges
Despite its practical and commercial successes,
machine learning remains a young field with
many underexplored research opportunities.
Some of these opportunities can be seen by con-
trasting current machine-learning approaches
to the types of learning we observe in naturally

Fig. 5. Data analytics stack. Scalable machine-learning systems are layered architectures that are
built on parallel and distributed computing platforms. The architecture depicted here—an open-
source data analysis stack developed in the Algorithms, Machines and People (AMP) Laboratory at
the University of California, Berkeley—includes layers that interface to underlying operating systems;
layers that provide distributed storage, data management, and processing; and layers that provide
core machine-learning competencies such as streaming, subsampling, pipelines, graph processing,
and model serving.

occurring systems such as humans and other
animals, organizations, economies, and biological
evolution. For example, whereas most machine-
learning algorithms are targeted to learn one
specific function or data model from one single
data source, humans clearly learn many differ-
ent skills and types of knowledge, from years
of diverse training experience, supervised and
unsupervised, in a simple-to-more-difficult se-
quence (e.g., learning to crawl, then walk, then
run). This has led some researchers to begin
exploring the question of how to construct com-
puter lifelong or never-ending learners that op-
erate nonstop for years, learning thousands of
interrelated skills or functions within an over-
all architecture that allows the system to im-
prove its ability to learn one skill based on
having learned another (26–28). Another aspect
of the analogy to natural learning systems sug-
gests the idea of team-based, mixed-initiative
learning. For example, whereas current machine-
learning systems typically operate in isolation
to analyze the given data, people often work
in teams to collect and analyze data (e.g., biol-
ogists have worked as teams to collect and an-
alyze genomic data, bringing together diverse
experiments and perspectives to make progress
on this difficult problem). New machine-learning
methods capable of working collaboratively with
humans to jointly analyze complex data sets
might bring together the abilities of machines
to tease out subtle statistical regularities from
massive data sets with the abilities of humans to
draw on diverse background knowledge to gen-
erate plausible explanations and suggest new
hypotheses. Many theoretical results in machine
learning apply to all learning systems, whether
they are computer algorithms, animals, organ-
izations, or natural evolution. As the field pro-
gresses, we may see machine-learning theory
and algorithms increasingly providing models
for understanding learning in neural systems,

organizations, and biological evolution and see
machine learning benefit from ongoing studies
of these other types of learning systems.

As with any powerful technology, machine
learning raises questions about which of its po-
tential uses society should encourage and dis-
courage. The push in recent years to collect new
kinds of personal data, motivated by its eco-
nomic value, leads to obvious privacy issues, as
mentioned above. The increasing value of data
also raises a second ethical issue: Who will have
access to, and ownership of, online data, and who
will reap its benefits? Currently, much data are
collected by corporations for specific uses leading
to improved profits, with little or no motive for
data sharing. However, the potential benefits that
society could realize, even from existing online
data, would be considerable if those data were to
be made available for public good.

To illustrate, consider one simple example
of how society could benefit from data that is
already online today by using this data to de-
crease the risk of global pandemic spread from
infectious diseases. By combining location data
from online sources (e.g., location data from cell
phones, from credit-card transactions at retail
outlets, and from security cameras in public places
and private buildings) with online medical data
(e.g., emergency room admissions), it would be
feasible today to implement a simple system to
telephone individuals immediately if a person
they were in close contact with yesterday was just
admitted to the emergency room with an infec-
tious disease, alerting them to the symptoms they
should watch for and precautions they should
take. Here, there is clearly a tension and trade-off
between personal privacy and public health, and
society at large needs to make the decision on
how to make this trade-off. The larger point of
this example, however, is that, although the data
are already online, we do not currently have the
laws, customs, culture, or mechanisms to enable

society to benefit from them, if it wishes to do so.
In fact, much of these data are privately held and
owned, even though they are data about each of
us. Considerations such as these suggest that
machine learning is likely to be one of the most
transformative technologies of the 21st century.
Although it is impossible to predict the future, it
appears essential that society begin now to con-
sider how to maximize its benefits.
