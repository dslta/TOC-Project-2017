A  novel  cutting  chatter  monitoring  method  is 
presented  by 
the  characteristics  of 
probability  density  of  the  cutting  system  vibration 
response.  When  the  cutting  is  stable,  the  vibration 
response  can  be  regarded  as  random  noise  and  the 
corresponding  probability  density  function  is  normal 
distributed. However, sinusoidal components dominate 
the  vibration  response  and  its  probability  density 
function  is  U-shaped  distributed  when  the  cutting 
process  experiences  chatter.  Thus  the  probability 
density of the vibration response is sensitive to cutting 
chatter and  is employed  as  the monitoring parameter 
in  this  study.  Neural  network  pattern  recognition 
technique  is  introduced  to  recognize  cutting  chatter 
considering  its  excellent  capability  of  classification. 
Experiments conducted on an engine lathe confirm that 
the  probability  density  of  the  vibration  response  a 
suitable monitoring parameter and cutting chatter can 
be successfully detected by the proposed method.  

1. Introduction 

    Cutting  chatter  is  a  dynamic  unstable  phenomenon 
in  cutting  system,  which  degrades  the  workpiece 
surface quality, reduces cutting tool and machine lives, 
and  even  worse  causes  the  failure  of  machine  tool. 
Chatter monitoring depends heavily on the selection of 
sensors, as well as on the data   processing techniques 
employed.  Excellent  reviews  on 
in 
machining  process  can  be  found  in  [1].  Generally, 
into  direct 
sensing 
measurement,  where 
is  obtained       
via signal processing and indirect measurement, where 
the  attribute  is  obtained  directly  from  the  signals. 
Typical  indirect  sensing  techniques,  such  as  dynamic 
force  [2,  3],  acceleration  [4,  5],  ultrasound  waves  [6] 
and drive current [7] can be utilized in cutting chatter 
monitoring.

The  purpose  of  cutting  chatter  monitoring  is  to 
detect the chatter and send alarm in the early stage of 
chatter  development  in  order  to  ensure  timely  chatter 
control mechanism can be triggered. Thus the selection 
of  monitoring  parameter  is  of  great  importance  to 
achieve  this  goal.  The  monitoring  parameter  must  be 
sensitive to cutting chatter and its processing time must  
be  short.  In  general,  statistical  parameters  including 
mean  value  and  standard  variance,  spectrum  analysis 
based  frequency  domain  parameters  and  wavelet 
analysis based time-frequency domain  parameters can 
be  employed  as  the  monitoring  parameters.  In  this 
paper, the probability density function of the vibration 
response,  a  new  monitoring  parameter,  is  introduced. 
The  calculation  of  monitoring  parameter  can  be 
conducted  just  in  time  domain  and  only  very  simple 
algorithm is involved, therefore the processing time is 
very short.  

2. Determination of monitoring parameter 

In  this  study,  probability  density  of  the  vibration 
response  is  utilized  as  the  monitoring  parameter  as  it 
varies  greatly  when  the  cutting  process  is  stable  and 
experiences  chatter.  In  stable  cutting,  the  vibration 
response 
 can  be  regarded  as  random  noise  and 
its probability density

    It  can  be  found  from  the  curves  in  Figure  1  that 
shapes of the probability density function curves varies 
significantly  corresponding  to  different  value  of  R .
When  the  cutting  is  stable,  the  vibration  response 
contains random noise only ( R =0) and its probability 
density  shows  normal  distribution.  When  R  increases 
gradually  from  zero  to  infinite,  the  sine  components 
increase  gradually  and  the  cutting  process  is  in  the 
transition process from stable cutting to unstable one. 
As R approaches infinite, the probability density of the 
vibration  response  presents  a  U-shaped  distribution, 
which  means  the  sine  component  dominates  the 
vibration  response  and  cutting  process  experiences 
strong chatter. 
    To  conclude  the  above  results,  the  probability 
density  function  of  the  cutting  system  vibration 
response is sensitive to the cutting states and it can be 
utilized as the parameter to monitor the cutting chatter 
online.  At  the  same  time,  the  calculation  of  this 
monitoring  parameter  is  in  time  domain  and  very 
simple algorithm is required. Therefore, it is confident 
that  the  cutting  chatter  can  be  detected  in  time  and 
reliable  chatter  control  can  be  achieved 
if  an 
appropriate control mechanism is employed.

3. Chatter monitoring scheme 

    Cutting  chatter  monitoring  can  be  regarded  as  a 
typical pattern recognition problem, and then it can be 
conducted by utilizing an effective pattern recognition 
method.  Pattern 
the  process  of 
identifying  objects  according  to  certain  features.  A 
whole  patter  recognition  process  can  be  divided  into 
the following three critical steps: 

recognition 

1) Sensing—to  pick  up  the  information  of  the 

is 

object by some kind of a transducer. 

2) Features extraction—to characterize an object 
to  be  recognized  by  measurements  whose 
values are very similar for objects in the same 
category  and  very  different  for  objects  in 
different category. 

3) Classification—to  assign  the  object  into  a 

category based on the extracted features. 

theory 

    The most classical pattern recognition problem is the 
statistical  one.  Bayesian  decision 
is  a 
fundamental  statistical  approach.  This  approach  is 
based  on  quantifying  the  tradeoffs  between  various 
classification decisions using probability and the costs 
that accompany such decisions. 
    However,  with 
the  development  of  artificial 
intelligence  in  recent  years,  new  pattern  recognition 
methods based on artificial intelligent techniques, such 
as neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms and 
expert  systems,  are  successfully  employed  in  many 
fields.  Especially, 
the  neural  network  pattern 
recognition methods have been verified as a powerful 
tool to solve the complicated classification problem. It 
has  been  proven  that  any  continuous  function  can  be 
implemented  in  a  three-layer  neural  network.  At  the 
same  time,  pattern  classification  is  considered  as 
perhaps  the  most  important  application  of  artificial 

neural  networks  as  a  majority  of  neural  networks 
applications  can  be  categorized  as  solving  complex 
pattern classification problems. 
    So a MLP neural network is employed in this paper 
to detect the cutting chatter. Then the next key problem 
is  how  to  extract  the  representative  features  from  the 
monitoring  parameter.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  the 
probability  density  function  of  the  vibration  response 
takes different looks corresponding to different cutting 
states.  Thus  the  frequency  numbers  of  standardized 
vibration amplitude falls in a certain range should vary 
obviously in different cutting states. In this study, the 
ranges for frequency numbers calculation are set as: [-
2.4 -2], [-1.4 -1], [-0.8 0.8], [1 1.4] and [2 2.4]. Then 
five values of frequency number are fed into a neural 
network with 20 hidden nodes and one output node for 
chatter  monitoring.  The  network  is  a  multilayer  type 
consisting  of  an  assemblage  of  neurons  that  are 
arranged into layers. The input layer contains 5 nodes 
and each node is connected to all the 20 neurons in the 
adjacent hidden layer. Similarly, each of the neurons in 
the  hidden  layer  is  connected  to  the  neuron  in  the 
output layer. 
    To conclude the above discussions, the novel chatter 
monitoring  scheme  as  shown  in  Figure  2  can  be 
achieved.  The  vibration  response  collected  from  the 
cutting  system  is  processed  first  to  calculate  the 
frequency numbers of standardized vibration amplitude 
falls in the five predetermined ranges. Then the values 
of frequency numbers are input to the neural network 
classifier.  Finally,  the  chatter  can  be  monitored  by 
investigating the neural network output.

4. Experimental verifications 

The experiments are carried out on a general engine 
lathe and a cylinder workpiece is machined, as shown 
in Figure 3. The tool holder is specially designed with 
low  rigidity  in  order  to  introduce  the  cutting  chatter 
easily. The acceleration response signal is picked up by 
an  accelerometer  mounted  on  the  end  of  the  cutter. 
Then  the  acceleration  response  signal  is  amplified  by 
the  charge  amplifier  and  fed  into  A/D  converter  for 
digitalization.  The  calculation  of 
the  monitoring 
parameter  and  pattern  recognition  are  processed  in  a 
computer.

responses

    Then  the  proposed  neural  network  based  chatter 
monitoring scheme is examined. The neural network is 
trained first by utilizing the data of vibration response 
collected in the cutting process. In the training process, 

the learning rate is set to 0.1 and the moment constant 
is set to 0.85. The output of the neural network is set to 
1  when  cutting  process  experiences  chatter  and  0  for 
stable  cutting.  The  weights  are  initialized  to  random 
value with uniformly distribution. After the successful 
training of neural network, it can be used to recognize 
the  cutting  state  and  indicate  whether  the  cutting 
chatter occurs or not. 

The  typical  results  of  many  tests  are  shown  in 
Figures 5 and 6 and let us look at Figure 5 first. In this 
figure, the time domain vibration response is displayed. 
At  the  beginning  of  cutting,  the  cutting  process  is 
stable and no chatter can be observed. But the cutting 
chatter gradually develops around 10s and very strong 
chatter  occurs  after  15s.  The  corresponding  output  of 
the  neural  network  is  depicted  in  Figure  6.  It  can  be 
easily found the neural network outputs values close to 
0  when  the  cutting  is  stable.  But  the  output  values 
increase gradually and values are close to 1 when the 
chatter  is  fully  developed.  If  we  set  the  threshold  for 
alarming as 0.5, the monitoring system can detect the 
cutting  chatter  at  10s  in  this  example,  i.e.  the  cutting 
chatter  is  detected  at  the  early  stage  of  chatter 
development.

Fig.6 Output of neural network 

Considering  the  successful  rate  of  the  proposed 
method  for  chatter  monitoring,  this  method  can  be 
combined with a chatter control system as a monitoring 
module to achieve stable cutting with high machining 
efficiency.  If  the  chatter  is  detected,  chatter  control 

mechanisms,  for  example,  varying  spindle  speed 
cutting  [8],  can  be  triggered  to  suppress  the  chatter 
under development. 

5. Conclusions 

The  probability  density  function  of  vibration 
response transits from normal distribution to U-shaped 
distribution  when  the  cutting  process  changes  from 
stable  state  to  unstable  one.  To  reflect  this  changing 
process, 
the  frequency  numbers  of  standardized 
vibration  amplitude  falls  in  the  predetermined  ranges 
are employed as the inputs of neural network classifier. 
The  verification  experiments  demonstrate  that  the 
probability  density  function  of  vibration  response  is 
sensitive to the cutting chatter. Moreover, the proposed 
neural  network  pattern  recognition  based  chatter 
monitoring method is proved to be a potential chatter 
detection technique with high accuracy and reliability.
